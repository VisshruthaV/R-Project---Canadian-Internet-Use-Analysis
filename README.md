# Internet Use Analysis Based On Canadian Demographics

This R project explores and analyzes the Internet use of people in Canada, based on a plethora of demographic parameters such as gender, age, province, region, employment status, education status, household status, etc. This analysis was done using exploratory analysis in R using tables, bar plots, jitter plots, and correlation matrices. Predictive analysis such as chi-sqaured testing, random forest models, and decision trees were implemented to predict internet use outcome based on the exploratory analysis insights.

The project aimed to answer three main questions:
- What does the spread of internet users look like between gender, province, age, and employment status? What relationships and correlations arise regarding the two? 
- Can I predict if a person is a long time internet user or a new internet user based on their demographic infomation.
- Can I predict how often a person uses the internet based on their demographic infomation.


## Installation / Viewing

1. Download files and run the main.R file in RStudio. This contains the R code for pre-processing data and the exploratory analysis.
2. The chiSquareTest.R and randomforest.R files show the respective predictive analysis methods for the project.
3. The exploratory_analysis.RMD file contains both the R code found in the main.R file as well as the markdown code for knitting the it onto the project HTML (https://rpubs.com/Group12_BSMM8740_Fall22/962411)
#### In order to view the full project, go to https://rpubs.com/Group12_BSMM8740_Fall22, where you will find the decision tree, correlation matrix, and the exploratory analysis HTML of the project.
